Welcome to my personal portfolio website! I'm Aydin Abedinia, a Senior Engineering Manager at Snapp! with over 12 years of experience in software engineering, specializing in Machine Learning. This site showcases my expertise, projects, and research in backend development and AI-driven solutions.

## About Me

As a seasoned software engineer, I've contributed to both startups and unicorn companies like Snapp!, focusing on building efficient, scalable systems. My passion lies in leveraging modern backend technologies and exploring innovative approaches in machine learning.

My research primarily revolves around decision tree algorithms, semi-supervised learning, and boosting techniques. I've developed novel algorithms such as SemiCart and Distance-Based-Weighting to enhance algorithm performance.

## Featured Projects
